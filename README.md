# Grab Repository
1. Open Terminal
2. `cd` into whatever folder you want to put this repo in ex: `~/Projects`
3. `git clone git@github.com:InDeepShip/InDeepShip.git`

# Software Requirements
## Bow (Client/Frontend Software)
```
    node == v12.19.0
    npm == v6.14.8
```

## Installation (Mac)
A Few tools that you can utilize in order to install the client code software
requirements is **homebrew** and **nvm**

### Homebrew Install
Run the following command to install Homebrew
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

### NVM Install
Nvm stands for Node Version Manager. Since the creation of Node there has been many version updates
(e.g, Node v6, Node v10, etc). The current Node version that is LTS is Node v12.19.0. So we will use
nvm to install the correct node js version. Install NVM with the following command
```
brew install nvm
```

### Node and NPM Install
```
nvm install v12
```
You should now have the correct version of **node** and **npm** installed. You can verify this on the command prompt
```
$ node --version
v12.19.0
```

## Installation (Windows)
You're on your own bud.


## Run Client Software
1. `cd InDeepShip/bow`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## Build Client Software
1. `cd InDeepShip/bow`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build` this builds a deployable software located at directory `./build`


## Aft (Server/Backend Software)
```
python >= 3.8.0
pip >= 19.2.3
```

### Python3 and Pip3 Install
```
brew install python
```
You should now have the correct (or newer) version of python3 and pip3.
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.8.3

$ pip3 --version
pip 19.2.3 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```

## Run Server Software
It is good practice to set up a virtual enviornment on your system for your `python` environment. What does that mean?
That basically means to create an environment that will keep track of your prefered version of **python** and **pip**.
And also an enviornment that will keep track of your python packages you will install (e.g. Django)

### Setup Virtual Environment
1. `cd InDeepShip/`
2. `python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./venv` this will create a directory `InDeepShip/venv` which
contains the python, pip and packages for your virtual environment
3. Now activate your virtual environment with command `source ./venv/bin/activate`
4. Install python packages required for backend software with command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Note: Exit Virtual Environment
1. You can exit your python virtual environment with command `deactivate` (Don't do this if you are trying to run software).

### Start Server Software
Following commands should be executed where **Setup Virtual Enviornemnt** left off.
1. `cd InDeepShip/aft` run command `python manage.py runserver`
2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

# Run Software (Both Client + Server)
So above we showed how to start the client code only. Or to start the server code. However for
development, you will want to watch modifications mades to your react client code so you can then
build the software and have Django backend render the built static assets and **index.html**.
Follow the instructions below to set this up.

1. Open up a terminal session
2. `cd InDeepShip/bow`
3. Run `npm run watch` this will watch your js and css files in case there are changes
in order to rebundle the client code.

4. Open another terminal session
5. Note: Make sure this terminal session has your **python virtaul enviornment** activated.
6. `cd InDeepShip/aft`
7. Run `python manage.py runserver` The Django Server should now render the react frontend code.
8. Visit `http://127.0.01:8000` to view application.

# Swagger UI
Swagger is a REST API documentation tool, and allows developers and end consumers to directly interact with the APIâ€™s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It's autogenerated from an OpenAPI spefication, in this case from [`drf-yasg`](https://github.com/axnsan12/drf-yasg) which generates OpenAPI 2.0 specifications from the Django Rest Framework API. It exposes validated and publicly available endpoints:

- `/swagger.json`: A JSON view of our API specification
- `/swagger.yaml`: A YAML view of our API specification
- `/swagger/`: A swagger-ui view of our API specification
- `/redoc/`: A ReDoc view of our API specification

Where the endpoints can be hit at a local backend Django webserver deployment, for example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/`
